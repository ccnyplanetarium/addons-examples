## Orient Image on Globe

### Adds an image to a globe, tangent to the surface at a particular point

The `add-images.asset` will take a square image and put it with its top edge facing north, at a particular lat/long on a globe.

The `globepositions.csv` file contains the data.

Right now, the globe is hardcoded into the asset, i.e. Mars, or Earth

To Do:

Add a globe column the csv file.

Usage:

Just add the asset to your profile and it should load the image.

You can adjust the opacity of the image in the GuiPath

You'll need to know the width of the image in meters. So that it is somewhat accurate.
